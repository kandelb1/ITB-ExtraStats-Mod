Scroll through the list and click on a game to view your stats!


### Vanilla Stats Browser

Ever been disappointed that ITB will only show you the top 5 scores for each of your squads? Now you can view ALL of your previous runs.
<img src="repository-resources/vanilla_stats_browser.png" />
Scroll through all of your past runs, sorted by score. Click on a game in the list to see your loadout and stats. Mouse over pilots and weapons to see their names and descriptions.
